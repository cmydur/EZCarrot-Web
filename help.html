        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <p> Q: What is ezcarrot?
        </p>
        <p> A: ezcarrot is a software platform that allows your customers to upload a screenshot of their social media post,
            online review, text message, email, etc. that promotes your business. You can then offer them a cash reward directly
            for promoting your business.
        </p>
        <p> Q: Is ezcarrot free?
        </p>
        <p> A: ezcarrot is free to sign up. You only pay when you decide to reward a customer for uploading a screenshot that
            promotes your business. You are not obligated to reward every screenshot that gets uploaded to your account.
        </p>
        <p> Q: How do I sign up my business?
        </p>
        <p> A: Go to www.ezcarrot.com and click the “BUSINESS LOGIN” and then “Register” button to register your business.
        </p>
        <p> Q: What is the mobile app for?
        </p>
        <p> A: The mobile app is for your customers to search for your business and then upload screenshots of their social media
            posts, online reviews, text messages, emails, etc. that promote your business. Businesses should not download
            the mobile app and instead should use www.ezcarrot.com to access their account by clicking the “BUSINESS LOGIN”
            button.
        </p>
        <p> Q: How do I pay?
        </p>
        <p> A: ezcarrot allows you to connect your credit card to your account. When you reward a customer for uploading a screenshot
            that promotes your business your credit card will be debited for that amount. Please note that ezcarrot charges
            a fee of 35% every time you reward a screenshot. For example, if you decide to reward a customer $1.00 for a
            screenshot your credit card will be debited $1.35 with $1.00 going to the customer and $0.35 going to ezcarrot.
        </p>
        <p> Q: How do my customers get paid?
        </p>
        <p> A: Once your customers have an account balance of at least $20.00 they may redeem those funds. When they redeem their
            funds a check for the amount in their account balance will be mailed to their address. They will also receive
            an email with the option of directly depositing the funds.
        </p>
        <p> Q: What should I do after I sign up my business?
        </p>
        <p> A: You should tell your customers that they can be rewarded by downloading the mobile app and uploading screenshots
            of their social media posts, online reviews, text messages, emails, etc. that promote your business. Check your
            account after receiving a notification or periodically to review screenshots and reward customers directly for
            promoting your business.
