                    a “Subscribing Entity”), you represent and warrant that:
                </p>
                <p class="marginP0">a. You are an authorized representative of the Subscribing Entity, and that you have the authority to bind

                    your username or password to any third party or permitting any third party to access your account, attempting
                    to impersonate another user or person, use of the Websites in any fraudulent or misleading manner, any
                    automated use of the system, such as scraping the Websites, automated scripts, spiders, robots, crawlers,
                    data mining tools or the like, interfering with, disrupting, or creating an undue burden on the Websites
                    or the networks or services connected to the Websites, and using the Websites in a manner inconsistent
                    with any and all applicable laws and regulations. Illegal and/or unauthorized use of the Websites may
                    be investigated, and appropriate legal action may be taken, including without limitation, civil, criminal,
                    and injunctive redress. Use of the Websites and Service is with the permission of ezcarrot, which may
                    be revoked at any time, for any reason, in ezcarrot’s sole discretion.

                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the username and password that you designate during the registration
                    process, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your username and password.
                    You agree to (a) immediately notify ezcarrot of any unauthorized use of your username or password or
                    any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.
                    ezcarrot will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.
                    You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that
                    others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information. If you share your
                    computer with others, you may wish to consider disabling your auto-login feature if you have it linked
                    to your ezcarrot account.

                    appearing in Your Content in order to include their name, voice, performance or likeness in Your Content
                    and to publish the same on the Websites and via any third party services.</p>
                <p>d. Your Content, including any comments that you may post on the Websites, is not and will not be unlawful,
